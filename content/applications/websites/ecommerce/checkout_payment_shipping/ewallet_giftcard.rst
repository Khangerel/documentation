eWallet and gift cards
======================

You can enable **eWallets** and **gift cards** for your customers on your eCommerce, which they can
use to for their online and in-store shopping. To allow eWallets and gift cards for your eCommerce,
head to :menuselection:`Website app --> eCommerce` and in the :guilabel:`Shop - Products` category,
enable :guilabel:`Discounts, Loyalty & Gift Card`.

eWallet
=======

eWallet allows customers to save their credits on their online account and use these credits as a
payment method when buying items on your online store. As multiple redeems for the same order are
not possible in Odoo, eWallets can also be used by customers to centralize multiple :ref:`gift cards
<ewallet_gift/gift-cards>` and accumulate credits.


Before creating an eWallet program, it is necessary to create an eWallet **top-up** product. Top-ups
are digital credits added to an eWallet in exchange for live currency. These credits can then be
used in the eCommerce shop as payment method. Top-up values can be of different amounts.

.. example::
   A $50 top-up can be bought for $50, and adds that same amount of credits in the eWallet.

To create a top-up **product**, go to :menuselection:`Website app --> eCommerce --> Products` and
:guilabel:`Create` a new product. On the product template, configure the product as such:

- :guilabel:`Can be sold`: enabled;
- :guilabel:`Product Type`: set as :guilabel:`Service`;
- :guilabel:`Invoicing Policy`: set as :guilabel:`Prepaid/Fixed Price`;
- :guilabel:`Create on Order`: select :guilabel:`Nothing`;
- :guilabel:`Sales Price`: type in the **amount** of the top-up.

.. note::
   If you wish to have eWallet **top-ups** of different amounts, repeat the process and modify the
   :guilabel:`Sales Price` accordingly.

Once the **top-up** is created, go to :menuselection:`Website app --> eCommerce --> Gift Cards &
eWallet` to :guilabel:`Create` an eWallet **program**. The following configuration options are
available:

- :guilabel:`Program Name`: enter the name you want;
- :guilabel:`Program Type`: select :guilabel:`eWallet`;
- :guilabel:`eWallet Products`: select the eWallet **top-up(s)** created earlier;
- :guilabel:`Email template`: the email template used for the email sent to the customer, you can
  create a template by clicking the field and selecting :guilabel:`Search more`;
- :guilabel:`Currency`: select the currency you wish to use for that eWallet program;
- :guilabel:`Company`: the company in which the program is valid and available;
- :guilabel:`Available On`: the different stores where the program is valid and available;
- :guilabel:`Website`: the website on which the program is valid and available, leave empty for all;
- :guilabel:`Point of Sale`: :abbr:`PoS (Point of Sale)` in which the program is valid and
  available, leave empty for all.
